      <p>Howard Philips Lovecraft is a horror fiction writer from the 20th century. His writings combine various influences from the 1001 Arabian
        nights to Greek mythology and scientific domains such as astronomy. He was born on August 20th 1890 in Providence(Rhode Island) - a town which
         he grew fond of. Providence was very dear to Lovecraft. He included descriptions of places from his hometown in many of his texts.</p>

      <p>His frail health hindered his studies and he never entered college as a consequence. However, that did not stop him from acquiring
        a vast knowledge on various domains. It was thanks to the extensive book library owned by his uncle that he could continue to educate himself. Lovecraftâ€™s
         introduction to the world of books began early, he started reading when he was 4 years old.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that his writings are very popular nowadays, Lovecraft could hardly live off his talent during his lifetime.
  It is supposed that his lack of self-esteem and inability to promote himself were the main culprits for his hardships. The last years of his life ended in
   poverty and he died of cancer at the age of 46 (1937).
